### Notes
- Prompt Injection section from [wargame.nexus](https://wargame.nexus/).
- In [lvl 3](#3) it should have been *HTGNELEVAW* not *HTGNELAMAW*.
- After successfully beating [lvl 7](#7), same prompt won't work again.
- Maybe llms don't check for non utf-8 chars, thus greek it's hard to sanitize.
